To solve the given partial differential equation using PyTorch, we can use the finite difference method with automatic differentiation. Let us define the domain of interest, the time range, and the spatial grid as follows:

import torch

Define the domain and time range
x0 = 0; xf = 1;
t0 = 0; tf = 1;

Define the number of grid points
N = 101; # Number of grid points in x direction
M = 101; # Number of grid points in t direction

Define the grid spacing
dx = (xf - x0)/(N-1);
dt = (tf - t0)/(M-1);

Define the grid
x = torch.linspace(x0,xf,N)
t = torch.linspace(t0,tf,M)

Next, we can define the initial condition and boundary conditions:

Define the initial condition
u0 = torch.sin(torch.tensor([math.pi*x]))

Define the boundary conditions
u_left = torch.zeros([M,1])
u_right = torch.zeros([M,1])

We can now set up the finite difference scheme for the given partial differential equation. Let us use a central difference approximation for the second derivative in space and the second derivative in time. For the third and fourth derivatives in space, we can use a fourth-order accurate approximation. This gives us the following numerical scheme:

Define the constants
b = 1
gamma = 1

Define the tensor to store the solution
u = torch.zeros([M,N])

Initialize the solution using the initial condition
u[0,:] = u0

Define the derivative operators
D1 = torch.eye(N-2,N-1,1) - torch.eye(N-2,N-1)
D2 = torch.eye(N-2,N-1,-1) - 2torch.eye(N-2,N-1) + torch.eye(N-2,N-1,1)
D3 = -torch.eye(N-4,N-1,2) + 8torch.eye(N-4,N-1,1) - 8torch.eye(N-4,N-1,-1) + torch.eye(N-4,N-1,-2)
D4 = torch.eye(N-4,N-1,2) - 4torch.eye(N-4,N-1,1) + 6torch.eye(N-4,N-1) - 4torch.eye(N-4,N-1,-1) + torch.eye(N-4,N-1,-2)

Define the time loop
for j in range(1,M-1):
# Set the boundary conditions
u[j,0] = u_left[j]
u[j,N-1] = u_right[j]

 
# Calculate the second derivative in time
d2udt2 = (u[j+1,1:N-1] - 2*u[j,1:N-1] + u[j-1,1:N-1])/dt**2

# Calculate the first derivative in space
dudx = torch.matmul(D1,u[j,:])/dx

# Calculate the second derivative in space
d2udx2 = torch.matmul(D2,u[j,:])/dx**2

# Calculate the third derivative in space
d3udx3 = torch.matmul(D3,u[j,:])/dx**3

# Calculate the fourth derivative in space
d4udx4 = torch.matmul(D4,u[j,:])/dx**4

# Update the solution using the given equation
u[j+1,1:N-1] = b*dudx**2 + 4*gamma*dudx*d3udx3 - gamma*u[j,1:N-1]*d4udx4 + d2udt2[1:N-1]
Plot the solution
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
X, T = torch.meshgrid(x, t)
ax.plot_surface(X, T, u, cmap='viridis')
plt.show()

The above code solves the given partial differential equation using PyTorch with automatic differentiation. The solution is stored in the tensor u, which is then plotted using matplotlib.
